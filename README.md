This is my coffee shop project. It's pretty darn close to the mock up if I do say so myself. 

This project presented me a couple challenges like the teadiousness of aligning, and trying to make containers before flex was intoduced. While this project took me to some frusturated spaces, but I learned a ton. 

One of my main take aways I got from this project was to pay close attention to the the z-index of parent elements. I'm really proud of my buttons. Even though its simple I like the reuseability of @mixin flex-center(). 

Some things I would include with a little more time are a little hover shiver over the products cards; use javascript to make the can stick to the position it stops at; zoom responsivness.
